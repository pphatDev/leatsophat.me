# LEAT Sophat 🌈🌞
Welcome to my portfolio - Thoughts from a wandering mind. I am the senior front-end developer of TurboTech, and an UI/UX designer. In my free time, I like design side projects and developing them.


## Clone the project 📂

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pphatdev/leatsophat.me.git
```

```sh
cd ./leatsophat.me
```

## To Start Project ♻️

### Config Database ⚙️

make sure your database local is working. copy `.env.exmaple` to `.env` than change the env configuration.

> If you skip this step you can't start the node service.

```env
# App Enviroment
VERSION="v1"
APP_NAME="REST APIs with NodeJs"
NODE_ENV="development"

# DB Connection
DB_HOST="your host"
DB_NAME="your database name"
DB_PORT="your PORT"
DB_USER="your username"
DB_PWD="your password"
```

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

```sh
npm install
```

### Starting Server 〽️

Finally you can start the project.

```sh
npm start
```

and these what you see on terminal! 😎

```bash
♻️  Starting with: [development] Mode!
